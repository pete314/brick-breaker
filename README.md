The Game features:

 - Pause and continue game(press "p" key to activate)
 - Levels with additional lives and extra rows
 
Technical features:
 - Responsive page width with auto adjusting column size
 - Ball canvas and brick collision detection
 - Key and mouse event handlers

Notes:

    During the development I had to realize that external objects in the form of functions or classes do not give correct collision results.
